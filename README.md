# DuoBot

Cooperative robot game prototype using Unity3D. Made for the [IncLudo](http://includo.in) project.

Play it at https://cybercri.github.io/DuoBot/

## Description of game

DuoBot is a single-player puzzle/platformer game about cooperation. It can be played directly on the web at https://cybercri.github.io/DuoBot/

## Requirements

Meant to be played on a desktop computer. No special requirements or setup should be required, as long as a modern browser that supports WebGL is used.

## How to Play

The controls are:

  - Left and right arrow keys to move.
  - Up arrow key to jump.
  - Space key for "special power". For the lightbulb this activates switches. For the shovel this picks up and throws items.
  - Ctrl key to switch robots.

There are 3 levels. The goal is always to get the robot to the portal at the end of the level. 

## Requested Feedback

We are looking to see if single-player platform and puzzle games are an effective means of reaching and interesting in our target audience. In addition, we would like to know if the technical requirements create a barrier.

Finally, we would like to know if the theme of cooperation sparks interesting conversations about the value of complementary teams from a diversity perspective.
